Your project overview:-
	Fraud detection methods are continuously developed to defend criminals in adapting to their fraudulent strategies.This project covers credit card fraud and is meant to look at a dataset of transactions and predict whether it is fraudulent or not. 

Problem statement:-
	Detecting credit card frauds.

Solution applied:-
	This data is fit into a model and the following outlier detection modules are applied on it:
	• Local Outlier Factor
	• Isolation Forest 
	
	Random Forest algorithm 

Results:-
	 For each algorithm is given in the output as follows, where class 0 means the transaction was determined to be valid and 1 means it was determined as a fraud transaction.

	Isolation Forest: 17
	Accurancy Score : 0.9974842767295597


	Local Outlier Factor: 21
	Accurancy Score : 0.9974842767295597

Conclusion:-
	The algorithm does reach over 99.7% accuracy
